When it became apparent that impact was immenent, humans panicked whilst Markizano took action and summoned the strength to slice the asteroid in half before impact. There was incredibly minimized damage to Earth as a result as only a few mediorites made contact with the atmosphere. Much of it burned in the atmosphere. The two halves bypassed the planet and fell out of orbit with Earth after this event.",

The impact could have severely disrupted life if not completely eliminated life as we know it on Earth. Markizano wasn't even recognized for the hero he was after this event as local Governments took the credit for what happened."
