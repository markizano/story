## 🪐 What Is This?

*Markizano Draconus* is more than a sci-fi saga.

It is the chronicle of what happens when a psionic being, born in deep space after the destruction of his homeworld, arrives on Earth with powers beyond comprehension and a heart fractured by loss, betrayal, and purpose.

Through books, shows, games, and visual experiences, you will watch Markizano evolve from a silent child into a galactic force. You will decide for yourself whether he is Earth’s salvation or its reckoning.

### 👤 Who is Markizano?

- Born aboard a spacefaring vessel in the Crux galaxy
- Gifted with telepathy and telekinesis
- Raised amid trauma and secrecy
- Struggling to balance power with humanity
